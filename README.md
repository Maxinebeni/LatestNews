This is a python render application that fetches News from the GNewsAPI and fetches the latest news in Health every 24hours. The GNews API however works only in 
development and not in production so therefore we had to save the articles we collected to show in production. As the web app grows we aim to be able to pay for 
the services and use this model to fetch News articles every 24hours.

The model is run through- python app.py
